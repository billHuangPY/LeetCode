"""
Given an array,
nums = [9, 1, 1, 22, 315, 215, 345]
Find how many possible pairs of (i,j), such that nums[i] and nums[j] have just one different digit.

For example from the above array:
(9, 1) is a valid pair
(1, 1) is not a valid pair because they are actually the same
(315, 215) is a valid pair
(215, 345) is not a valid pair because they have two different digits
(315, 345) is a valid pair

The answer of the example is 4
